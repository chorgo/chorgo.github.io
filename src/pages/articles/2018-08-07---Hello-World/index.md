When I created this site, it was supposed to be my iOS blog, where I wanted to talk about current topics that are interesting for me. However, for one reason or another, I've never gotten around to start it. And as it is with most things, starting is often the hardest but most important part.

At the time I was initially thinking about starting a blog, I was still a Lead iOS Engineer at Storii, and we considered to start a tech blog to raise our profile. Though, as it happens with startups, our's lost funding at the end of '17 and I needed to find a new role. After I found that, the thought of starting a blog crossed my mind again, however with settling in at the new role, I never had the energy to really get behind it.

At the beginning of '18, a couple of former colleagues and I thought about starting a new side project together. We like working together, and thought it would be quite fun, to have a side project, we could put some of our free time towards.

Together with the former Head of Product and the former CTO of Storii, we came up with an idea, which we found quite interesting, and not to complex to start with. We discussed several ideas and formed an early road map. The CTO, however, dropped off the radar after a couple of months chatting about the project. Since we didn't want to do this with just two guys, we invited the former Head of Sales of Storii to join us. We thought we could need his experience in selling and marketing to get this project off the shelves a little bit faster.

After a couple of weeks planning, we settled on an MVP roadmap and started building. This is the point we are currently at. Since I'm the only developer left, I'll do all the backend development, and with the help of the HoP, the frontend.

And this is what the blog will be about in the next couple of months. I hope it helps me to focus my thoughts when I'm writing about the topics I'm currently thinking about. Perhaps there will be some iOS themed posts down the line, but the main focus will be about our side project.

To give some sort of baseline, I'm developing the backend using Django with a PostgreSQL database, and build a GraphQL endpoint on top of this. In the end, this will be deployed to AWS using the Elastic Beanstalk, but that's going to happen once most of the development is done. I've already set up the database models, and am currently thinking about authorization. I've got a plan in mind, which I will be talking about in my next post.
