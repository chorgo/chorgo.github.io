When I created this site, it was supposed to be my iOS blog, where I wanted to talk about current topics that are interesting for me. However, for one reason or another, I've never gotten around to start it. And as it is with most things, starting is often the hardest but most important part.

At the time I was initially thinking about starting a blog, I was still an iOS Engineer at Storii, and we considered to start a tech blog to raise our profile. Though, as it happens with startups, ours lost funding at the end of '17 and I needed to find a new role. After I found that, the thought of starting a blog crossed my mind again, however with settling in at the new role, I never had the time to get behind it.

Now with the coming release of SwiftUI and Combine, two frameworks which excite me, and since I'm not able to use those in my current role, I'm working on an app in my own time.
While doing this, I will regularly post my thoughts about SwiftUI and Combine, and perhaps share some ideas I developed over time using this.
