When I created this site, it was supposed to be my iOS blog, where I wanted to talk about current topics that are interesting for me. However, for one reason or another, I've never gotten around to start it. And as it is with most things, starting is often the hardest but most important part.

At the time I was initially thinking about starting a blog, I was still an iOS Engineer at Storii, and we considered to start a tech blog to raise our profile. Though, as it happens with startups, ours lost funding at the end of '17 and I needed to find a new role. After I found that, the thought of starting a blog crossed my mind again, however with settling in at the new role, I never had the time to get behind it.

With my move to Germany last year the same process started over again. I had no time because of the relocation, but I hope I get around to it in 2021.
